First project proposed in the Oracle Next Educaction Program

In this project I have created a page in which you can encrypt and decrypt a message, wanna play?
It is very simple, just follow these instructions:

1. First add a message in the input area
2. If you want to encrypt your message just click on the **encryp** button, then you will see you secret message.
3. To decrypt just add a secret message in the input area, then click **decrypt** button and that's all
4. As an extra activity, I have added a copy button

This project includes some popup windows.
I hope you enjoyed it.
